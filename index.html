    <h1>Brought to the Water</h1>

    <p>Where has my passion gone?
        Has it been carried off
        By some lonely driver in a line of fluorescent light?
        Has it been blurred together
        In ribboned patterns on the night?</p>
    <p>Lines of a red light
        Blurred together in ribboned patterns</p>
    <p>Along the stretch of some unnamed plane
        We began again
        I saw in your face that
        We are the same when we began again</p>
    <p>A multiverse of fuchsia and violet
        A multiverse of fuchsia and violet
        Surrenders to blackness
        Surrenders to blackness</p>
    <p>My world closes its eyes to
        Sex and laughter</p>
