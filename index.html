            <h2>A Dracula Excerpt</h2>

            <div>
                <p>24 October.--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: "Not yet
                    reported." Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and
                    creaking masts. 25 October.--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me;
                    but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his
                    telegram from Lloyd's. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
                    Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she
                    did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to
                    show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no
                    matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past
                    three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back
                    some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often; we have not, however,
                    said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that
                    we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully,
                    whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen
                    there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be necessary to
                    take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts
                    to each other. We should neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
                    "Euthanasia" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.</p>

                <p>It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has
                    come from London. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly
                    get in before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one o'clock, so as to be
                    ready.</p>

                <p>25 October, Noon.--No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was
                    the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever
                    of excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him
                    whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad
                    lookout for the Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat, driven by that stern,
                    ice-cold hand!</p>

                <p>Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About noon she got into a sort of
                    lethargy which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy
                    about it. She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was
                    sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he
                    could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked
                    so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else. Poor girl,
                    she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her
                    good.</p>

                <p>Later.--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she
                    seemed brighter and better than she had been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report.
                    Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To his doom, I trust!
                </p>

                <p>26 October.--Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine. She ought to be here by now. That
                    she is still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was
                    still the same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the
                    steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We
                    must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.</p>
